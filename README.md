Welcome to a Python Programming Project!
========================================

This is an instructional project on using Python to build a video game based on the 
popular Frogger (tm) game of the 1980's and 90's distributed by Sega and Sega-Gremlin. 
This instructional project and series of videos in no way attempts to replace or 
compete with the Frogger video game. The project is intended to teach computer programming
in a fun and interesting way. 

Prerequisites
---------------

Please see the [setting up video](http://youtube.com/CSProfessor/) for instructions on 
installing the required software on your computer. You can follow along on this video to get all the software installed. 

If you choose, you may follow the steps below instead of watching the set up video. 
To begin, you must have Git, Python 3, and Wing IDE 101 installed on your computer. First check and see if a system administrator or teacher has installed this software for you. If no one has installed this software, then you can download these packages from these locations. Be sure to get the Windows version if you are running Microsoft Windows or the Mac version if you are running Mac OS X. 

* Git
	+ [Git For Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
	+ [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	+ Be sure to click on the Download link for Python 3.x.y on the page. Using Python 2.x.y will not work for this instructional project. 
* [Wing IDE 101 from Wingware.com](http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101/)
	+ This is a free program from Wingware. The program is free for educational use.


Configuring Wing 101
---------------------

After downloading and installing the programs above, you must configure Wing IDE 101 to run Python 3. Find the Wing IDE 101 application under the Start Menu on Windows or under Applications on a Mac. Open Wing and consent to the free license. Then go to the Edit menu. Select *Configure Python...*, click the *Custom* radio buttonn next to the **Python Executable* part of the dialog box, and in the text box below the radio button type *python3* as the executable. Make sure you type *python3* in all lower case letters with no spaces. Wing IDE 101 will ask if you want to restart the shell which you want to do that this time. 

The Lessons
-------------
Once you have completed the steps under the prerequisites and configured Wing 1010 you are ready to begin the lessons. You do the lessons by watching each video, following the steps contained in each. 

You will be asked to pause videos at certain points. You should pause them and then try the indicated excercises. When you restart the video you will be shown the correct answer to give you immediate feedback. 

Don't worry if something gets messed up in your code at some point in a lesson. You can always restart a lesson by watching the video again. **Just be aware that any changes you make to the project will be lost when you reset the lesson or switch to the next lesson.** These lessons are intended for instruction and practice. So, if you want to save your work, save your program to a different location, other than the location indicated in each video. 

To get the most from these lessons, watch them in order and do the indicated exercises until you feel comfortable you understand all the concepts that are taught. If you feel you need additional information, you may find online resources for learning Python programming or you can buy the text [Python Programming Fundamentals](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Fundamentals-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/1849965366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457286492&sr=8-1&keywords=python+programming+fundamentals) by me. It contains additional information and useful exercises with solutions provided to practice problems in the text.

Have fun and enjoy the lectures and building an arcade game in Python!
